## Using the SDK
Simply import the SDK and provide the API credentials provided to you. They may 
be an API Token or OAuth 2.0 Credentials. Examples are listed below for each 
feature.

### Customer Management ###

Our Customer Management service provides administrative operations to manage 
Customer accounts and Customer User accounts for a Partner. These operations 
allow a partner to automate administrative tasks on their customers and 
customer user accounts. 

To use this Customer Management service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Customer

Customer Account Management Operations allows management of customer accounts

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	newCustomer := customer.Customer{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := customer.NewAddCustomerParams()
	addParams.Customer = newCustomer
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomer(*addParams)
	// ...
}
```

#### Customer User

Customer User Account Management Operations allows you to manage user accounts 
under a (parent) customer.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	customerUser := customer.CustomerUser{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := customer.NewAddCustomerUserParams()
	addParams.CustomerUser = customerUser
	// ...
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomerUser(*addParams)
	// ...
}
```

### Edge CNAME ###

Our User-Friendly URL, also known as Edge CNAME, takes advantage of an Edge CNAME 
configuration and a CNAME record to provide a friendlier alternative to a CDN URL. 
An edge CNAME URL is specific to the platform from which it was configured.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Edge CNAME](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Creating_an_Alias_for_a_CDN_URL.htm)

To use the edge CNAME service, use the API Token provided to you.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	edgecnameService, err := edgecname.New(sdkConfig)
	cname := edgecname.EdgeCname{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := edgecname.NewAddEdgeCnameParams()
	addParams.EdgeCname = cname
	// ...
	resp, err := edgecnameService.AddEdgeCname(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Customer Origin 

Our Customer Origin Service allows you to serve content stored or generated by 
third-party web servers (e.g., web hosting) via the CDN by:

- Creating a customer origin configuration. This type of configuration maps one 
or more servers to a CDN URL.
- (Optional) Creating an edge CNAME configuration that allows you to serve traffic 
via the CDN without having to update your links. This type of configuration maps 
a customer origin configuration to a CNAME record.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Customer Origin](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Customer_Origin_Server.htm)

To use the Customer Origins service, use the API Token provided to you.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	originService, err := origin.New(sdkConfig)
	newOrigin := origin.Origin{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := origin.NewAddOriginParams()
	// ...
	addParams.Origin = newOrigin
	resp, err := originService.AddOrigin(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Route (DNS) - BETA ###

Our Route (DNS) solution is a reliable, high performance, and secure DNS service 
that provides capabilities such as:

- Load balance traffic for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone hosted 
on another DNS system.
- Establish a failover system for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone 
hosted on another DNS system.
- Create a standard DNS zone. Optionally, load balance or failover requests to 
that zone.
- Import a secondary DNS zone by creating a master server group and a secondary 
zone group.
- Verify a server's capability to fulfill requests through health checks performed 
from around the world.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Route (DNS)](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#Route/Route_DNS.htm%3FTocPath%3DRoute%2520(DNS)%7C_____0)

To use the Route(DNS) service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Master Server Group

A master server group allows quick and easy management of master name servers, 
while a secondary zone group defines the secondary zones that will be imported 
from servers defined in a master server group and any TSIG keys that should be 
used for the zone transfer.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/routedns"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	routeDNSService, err := routedns.New(sdkConfig)
	masterServerGroup := buildMasterServerGroup()
	addParams := routedns.NewAddMasterServerGroupParams()
	addParams.MasterServerGroup = masterServerGroup
	// ...
	resp, err := routeDNSService.AddMasterServerGroup(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Real Time Log Delivery (RTLD)

Our Real-Time Log Delivery (RTLD) service delivers log data in near real-time 
to a variety of destinations.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Real-Time Log Delivery (RTLD)](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#RTLD/RTLD.htm%3FTocPath%3DReports%2520and%2520Log%2520Data%7CReal-Time%2520Log%2520Delivery%7C_____0).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.

#### Real-Time Log Delivery Rate Limiting (RTLD Rate Limiting)

Delivers log data that describes requests for which Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
enforced a rate limit as defined through a rate rule.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	idsCredentials := edgecast.IDSCredentials{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Scope:        scope,
	}
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.IDSCredentials = idsCredentials
	rtldService, err := rtld.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := profiles_rl.NewProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSettingParams()
	addParams.SettingDto = &rtldmodels.RateLimitingProfileDto{
		// ...
	}
	addResp, err :=
		rtldService.ProfilesRl.ProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSetting(addParams)
	// ...
}
```

### Rules Engine

Our Rules Engine allows the customization of requests handled by our CDN. 
Sample customizations that may be performed are:

Override or define a custom cache policy
Secure or deny requests for sensitive content
Redirect requests to a different URL

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Custom Request Handling via Rules Engine](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#HRE/HRE.htm).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.
A Policy should be constructed as a JSON object passed as a string.

```go
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	policyString := `{
		// ...
	}`
	idsCredentials := edgecast.IDSCredentials{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Scope:        scope,
	}
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.IDSCredentials = idsCredentials
	rulesengineService, err := rulesengine.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := rulesengine.NewAddPolicyParams()
	addParams.PolicyAsString = policyString
	addPolicyResp, err := rulesengineService.AddPolicy(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Our WAF service provides a layer of security between many security threats and 
your external web infrastructure. WAF increases security by monitoring, detecting, 
and preventing application layer attacks. It inspects inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic 
against reactive and proactive security policies and blocks malicious activity 
in-band and on a real-time basis.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Web-Security/Web-Security.htm%3FTocPath%3DSecurity%7CWeb%2520Application%2520Firewall%2520(WAF)%7C_____0).

To use the WAF service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Access Rules
An access rule identifies legitimate traffic and threats by ASN, Cookie, Country, 
IP Address, Referrer, URL, User agent, HTTP method, Media type, File extension, 
and Request headers.

For detailed information about Access Rules in WAF, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Access-Rules.htm).

#### Bot Rule Sets
Use bot rules to require a client (e.g., a web browser) to solve a challenge 
before resolving the request. WAF blocks traffic when the client cannot solve 
this challenge within a few seconds. Basic bots typically cannot solve this type
of challenge, and therefore their traffic is blocked. This prevents them from 
scraping your site, carding, spamming your forms, launching DDoS attacks, and 
committing ad fraud.

For detailed information about Bot Rules in WAF, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Bot-Rules.htm).

#### Custom Rule Sets
Use custom rules to tailor how WAF identifies malicious traffic. This provides
added flexibility for threat identification that allows you to target malicious
traffic with minimal impact on legitimate traffic. Custom threat identification
combined with rapid testing and deployment enables you to quickly address 
long-term and zero-day vulnerabilities.

For detailed information about Custom Rules in WAF, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Custom-Rules.htm).

#### Managed Rules
Managed Rules identify malicious traffic via predefined rules. A collection of 
policies and rules is known as a rule set.

For detailed information about Managed Rules in WAF, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Managed-Rules.htm).

#### Rate Rules
Rate Rules restricts the flow of site traffic with the intention of:
- Diverting malicious or inadvertent DDoS traffic.
- Preventing a customer origin server from being overloaded.
- Requests that exceed the rate limit may be dropped, redirected to another
URL, or sent a custom response.

For detailed information about Rate Rules in WAF, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Rate-Rules.htm).
