### Customer Management ###

Our Customer Management service provides administrative operations to manage 
Customer accounts and Customer User accounts for a Partner. These operations 
allow a partner to automate administrative tasks on their customers and 
customer user accounts. 

To use this Customer Management service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Customer

Customer Account Management Operations allows management of customer accounts

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	newCustomer := customer.Customer{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := customer.NewAddCustomerParams()
	addParams.Customer = newCustomer
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomer(*addParams)
	// ...
}
```

#### Customer User

Customer User Account Management Operations allows you to manage user accounts 
under a (parent) customer.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	customerUser := customer.CustomerUser{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := customer.NewAddCustomerUserParams()
	addParams.CustomerUser = customerUser
	// ...
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomerUser(*addParams)
	// ...
}
```

### Edge CNAME ###

Our User-Friendly URL, also known as Edge CNAME, takes advantage of an Edge CNAME 
configuration and a CNAME record to provide a friendlier alternative to a CDN URL. 
An edge CNAME URL is specific to the platform from which it was configured.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Edge CNAME](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Creating_an_Alias_for_a_CDN_URL.htm)

To use the edge CNAME service, use the API Token provided to you.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	edgecnameService, err := edgecname.New(sdkConfig)
	cname := edgecname.EdgeCname{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := edgecname.NewAddEdgeCnameParams()
	addParams.EdgeCname = cname
	// ...
	resp, err := edgecnameService.AddEdgeCname(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Customer Origin 

Our Customer Origin Service allows you to serve content stored or generated by 
third-party web servers (e.g., web hosting) via the CDN by:

- Creating a customer origin configuration. This type of configuration maps one 
or more servers to a CDN URL.
- (Optional) Creating an edge CNAME configuration that allows you to serve traffic 
via the CDN without having to update your links. This type of configuration maps 
a customer origin configuration to a CNAME record.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Customer Origin](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Customer_Origin_Server.htm)

To use the Customer Origins service, use the API Token provided to you.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	originService, err := origin.New(sdkConfig)
	newOrigin := origin.Origin{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := origin.NewAddOriginParams()
	// ...
	addParams.Origin = newOrigin
	resp, err := originService.AddOrigin(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Route (DNS) - BETA ###

Our Route (DNS) solution is a reliable, high performance, and secure DNS service 
that provides capabilities such as:

- Load balance traffic for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone hosted 
on another DNS system.
- Establish a failover system for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone 
hosted on another DNS system.
- Create a standard DNS zone. Optionally, load balance or failover requests to 
that zone.
- Import a secondary DNS zone by creating a master server group and a secondary 
zone group.
- Verify a server's capability to fulfill requests through health checks performed 
from around the world.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Route (DNS)](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#Route/Route_DNS.htm%3FTocPath%3DRoute%2520(DNS)%7C_____0)

To use the Route(DNS) service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Master Server Group

A master server group allows quick and easy management of master name servers, 
while a secondary zone group defines the secondary zones that will be imported 
from servers defined in a master server group and any TSIG keys that should be 
used for the zone transfer.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/routedns"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	routeDNSService, err := routedns.New(sdkConfig)
	masterServerGroup := buildMasterServerGroup()
	addParams := routedns.NewAddMasterServerGroupParams()
	addParams.MasterServerGroup = masterServerGroup
	// ...
	resp, err := routeDNSService.AddMasterServerGroup(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Real Time Log Delivery (RTLD)

Our Real-Time Log Delivery (RTLD) service delivers log data in near real-time 
to a variety of destinations.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Real-Time Log Delivery (RTLD)](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#RTLD/RTLD.htm%3FTocPath%3DReports%2520and%2520Log%2520Data%7CReal-Time%2520Log%2520Delivery%7C_____0).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.

#### Real-Time Log Delivery Rate Limiting (RTLD Rate Limiting)

Delivers log data that describes requests for which Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
enforced a rate limit as defined through a rate rule.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	idsCredentials := edgecast.IDSCredentials{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Scope:        scope,
	}
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.IDSCredentials = idsCredentials
	rtldService, err := rtld.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := profiles_rl.NewProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSettingParams()
	addParams.SettingDto = &rtldmodels.RateLimitingProfileDto{
		// ...
	}
	addResp, err :=
		rtldService.ProfilesRl.ProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSetting(addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Rules Engine

Our Rules Engine allows the customization of requests handled by our CDN. 
Sample customizations that may be performed are:

Override or define a custom cache policy
Secure or deny requests for sensitive content
Redirect requests to a different URL

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Custom Request Handling via Rules Engine](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#HRE/HRE.htm).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.
A Policy should be constructed as a JSON object passed as a string.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	policyString := `{
		// ...
	}`
	idsCredentials := edgecast.IDSCredentials{
		ClientID:     clientID,
		ClientSecret: clientSecret,
		Scope:        scope,
	}
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.IDSCredentials = idsCredentials
	rulesengineService, err := rulesengine.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := rulesengine.NewAddPolicyParams()
	addParams.PolicyAsString = policyString
	addPolicyResp, err := rulesengineService.AddPolicy(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Our WAF service provides a layer of security between many security threats and 
your external web infrastructure. WAF increases security by monitoring, detecting, 
and preventing application layer attacks. It inspects inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic 
against reactive and proactive security policies and blocks malicious activity 
in-band and on a real-time basis.

For more information, please read the [official documentation for Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Web-Security/Web-Security.htm%3FTocPath%3DSecurity%7CWeb%2520Application%2520Firewall%2520(WAF)%7C_____0).

To use the WAF service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Access Rules
An access rule identifies legitimate traffic and threats by ASN, Cookie, Country, 
IP Address, Referrer, URL, User agent, HTTP method, Media type, File extension, 
and Request headers.
```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig()
	sdkConfig.APIToken = "MY API TOKEN"
	wafService, err := waf.New(sdkConfig)
	rule := waf.AccessRule{
		// ... 
	}
	resp, err := wafService.AddAccessRule(rule)
// ...
}
```
